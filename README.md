Creating a project to list down all my favourite movies and rate them accordingly.

created three spring boot projects

1. movie-catalog-service (add an API to movie-catalog-service at /catalog/{userId})
2. movie-info-service (add an API to movie-info-service at /movies/{movieId})
3. rating-data-service (add an API to rating-data-service at /ratingsdata/{movieId}) by using https://start.spring.io

and then established microservice connection between them using Rest call.
